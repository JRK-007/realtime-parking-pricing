# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

> 📊 **Capstone Project | Summer Analytics 2025**
> Hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club × Pathway

---

## 📚 Project Summary

This project simulates a **dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots**, designed to optimize utilization based on real-time demand, competition, and environment conditions.

We used:
- 📈 **Historical & real-time data** from 14 parking spaces over 73 days
- 🧮 Implemented all models from scratch using **Python, Numpy, Pandas**
- 🚀 Streamed data & predictions using **Pathway**
- 📊 Visualized real-time pricing with **Bokeh**

---

## 💡 Models Implemented

- **Model 1:** Baseline linear pricing based on occupancy
- **Model 2:** Demand function using occupancy, queue, traffic, special days, vehicle type
- **Model 3:** Competitive pricing with geo-location proximity and competitor rates

---

## ⚙️ Execution

- 🔥 All code and simulations written & executed in **Google Colab**
- Real-time data ingestion & processing via **Pathway**
- Visualized dynamic price curves for each parking lot using **Bokeh**

---

## 📝 Deliverables

- 📔 Well-commented **Google Colab notebook**
- 📊 Real-time line plots comparing own vs competitor pricing
- 📝 Report explaining demand functions, assumptions, and pricing logic

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Showcased how **data-driven pricing** can reduce overcrowding & increase revenue
- Integrated economics + machine learning for practical smart-city use cases
- Built fully from scratch without high-level ML libraries
